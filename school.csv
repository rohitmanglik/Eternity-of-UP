The headmistress was always available if we had a concern.', 'The only issue we has was with their daily snack menu which only allowed vegetarian food, and banned Maggi, Kurkure, Lays and other foods from school.   I found it difficult to send appropriate snack items to school, because almost everything that my son likes to eat was banned from his snack box.', 'I think they can be a little flexible about snacks since so many children are fussy about food these days.  I understand   that junk food is bad for kids and this is the reason for the strict snack plan, but some parents will find it difficult to pack snacks, especially if your child loves packaged snacks. Otherwise, we had no complaints with the school.', 'After a lot of investigations into preschools, I chose Jumbo Kids for my son\xe2\x80\x99s playschool.  I have been happy with the choice so far.  Bright and welcoming facility, with cheerful teachers. Security is top- notch and they have a good system in place for pickups and drop offs, which was quite reassuring for me.', 'Prior to joining, I was informed that there would be a snack menu every week and snacks would have to adhere to the chart.  This was difficult for us and it was the only negative we had.  Planning snacks daily was a major tsk for us, since the options were limited and we are non-vegetarians.   (The school only allows veg food.)  Other than that, it was a great experience, and my son loved the activities and his teacher!', 'We chose Podar Jumbo Kids for our daughter\xe2\x80\x99s Nursery program this year.  Very child-centric approach that places no pressure on kids and yet encourages learning.  There were very few books in the admission kit, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe school books are necessary for a Nursery child anyway.  In any case, the school had a well-equipped library with frequent book sessions every month.  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want a high-pressure environment for a 2.5 year-old, and the school provided the easy-paced, yet effective learning system that other branded schools only talk about.', 'I first admitted my son into Jumbo Kids for the Nursery program, and he just finished Junior KG this year.  It has been a great experience.  Initially I was quite concerned, because there is absolutely no book-based writing in the Nursery program, and I was worried about how he would cope with writing in Junior KG.', 'The writing pace in Junior Kindergarten was quite slow at the beginning, but I have found it to be quite right for my child.  By the end of the year, he was able to complete all his writing milestones, which was good enough for me.', 'Overall, I like their child-friendly, slow-paced teaching style, which really lets children be children, and enjoy their preschool years, without placing them in a heavy pressure- cooker style environment.', 'This is a great school - welcoming and warm environment for kids, and lovely teachers! My son spent two years here and was very happy. He loved his teachers a lot, especially (insert some teacher\xe2\x80\x99s name here)!', ""At first, I did have concerns about the slow pace of writing. The school doesn't believe in putting small children under pressure to write. I was especially concerned about how he would cope in a mainstream school. He is now in UKG and writing with no problems. The school focuses heavily on personality development, social skills and language development, and all of those improvements are clear to see in my son now!"", 'I sent my daughter to (insert center here) for her Nursery program and she loved it! They took great care of her, and the teachers, staff and center were always easily available and accessible to address my concerns.', ""I think they could vary the menu a bit at their day care facility. They don't allow parents to send food from home, which I can understand, but then these are preschoolers, and the only issue that I had with the school was. Otherwise, there were no complaints. Events at the school were amazing, very well organized, and encouraged parents to participate. I especially loved the Master chef event that they had last year as well as the Father's Day celebration."", 'Overall, this is an excellent school.

The attempt has been to create a stimulating environment without overpowering the children's senses and cluttering their orderly lives and little minds. The adage 'less is more' applies here. A nature table, natural fibre and material for toys, simple homely everyday materials, which are from the realm of nature, are objects that children play with (nothing complicated or fancy like clockwork engines or Barbie dolls). The dolls and stuffed animals, which the children play with, are often made by the teacher to give urban children a feel of nature and help to enhance and retain their natural creativity and curiosity. Prakriti is a Waldorf Kindergarten with a vision for the development of the ""Whole child"" i.e., the body, mind and soul or simply the 3 Hs - The Head, The Heart and The Hands. The School aims at giving the children ample scope for doing what they are best at: being children. There is no sign of a blackboard or books, yet, they learn a great deal simply by doing, by imitating what is being done around them. The children are not made to fit into a readymade curriculum but rather the curriculum is fitted in according to the needs of the child. The faculty of imitation is strongest at this age, and the children learn by using their senses, their limbs and their power of observation. Prakriti is an active place, where children can give full expression to their imagination and create a world of magic with the help of very simple means, guided by the gentle but firm personality of the Waldorf Inspired teacher. Here, there is no teacher and the taught, but an adult to love, imitate and learn from! Today's generation require a stress free schooling and not a paper-pencil academic learning. What they need most is 'Preparation to face Life's challenges', for which they need natural intelligence, high self esteem, self confidence and a great deal of self-belief....leading to ""Everyone should be his/her own King./Queen"".DetailsYear Established:1900",[],[]

But we aim to be a second home. We aspire to pioneer Montessori approach in its true sense.Any school can have an impressive array of materials and the superficial appearance of a ""good"" school, but ""Growing wonders"" has far more to offer than just that. ""Growing wonders"" resembles the family structure. Our success in nurturing development is probably due in large part to the fact that it is modeled on natural family-like patterns of teaching-learning.Children learn for more from imitation of what they see and do than from what they hear, which is why its vital to have positive rapport between the children and the teachers who are observing and directing them. At ""Growing wonders"" we don't have teachers, but ""aunts"" who are all Montessori trained and have teaching values. They substitute the mother's role and guide and prepare your child for a lifetime of learning.The first six years of a child's life when unconscious learning takes place, is most important. A child's first school experience has a great effect on his future feeling concerning school and the learning process, which is why it would be a wise decision to make your child part of ""Growing wonders""DetailsManagement:Mr.B.P.Suresh Kumar. ME MIE, MIIF MISTEInfrastructure:What's most unique about ""Growing wonders"" is its infrastructure that is purpose built. Every room is spacious, has an excellent ventilation system and fixtures on the ceiling that spread light all over the room.Each room is also painted in a different color. Colors are known to have varying effects on us. Colors like orange, violet, blue, green and yellow, symbolize tranquility, intellect, vibrance, humility, warmth and exude positive energy. Even the bathrooms are child-friendly. The sinks and the toilet seats are amicably placed.The play area is conveniently situated at the back of the building to avoid any untoward incidents. Also in store are picnics and field trips, because we consider it important to experience not just the home environment, but also the world outside. When we say ""child-centric"", we mean it! Special care has gone into every detail in ""Growing wonders"", because we understand the joys of growing-up.Additional Details:""Growing wonders"" is a part of Sujay Group, a name to reckon with in the outdoor advertising industry.  With more than three decades of experience in innovating the outdoor media, we have now rightly diversified into the field of education.""Growing wonders"" was born out of the need for ""holistic development"". It is managed by people who are very well-educated and motivated to ""make a difference"". ""Growing wonders"" board of advisors includes renowned and experienced trainers from various streams of education.Most importantly, ""Growing wonders"" is backed by people who are passionate about children and are concerned about how they can contribute to a ""fruitful future.""",['https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/school/photo/237-large.jpg'],[]

SHEMROCK is promoted by the Arora family – which consists of two generations of the country’s leading educationists with over 100 years of combined experience in the field of education. It all started when Dr. D.R Arora and Dr. (Mrs.) Bimla Arora – a husband-wife team of academicians envisioned a school that presented the children with an education system that was based on their 30 years of academic experience in India and Abroad.

At the same time, we are unique in the way we have kept abreast with the new trends in education and have responded to the changing needs of children.St. Mary’s has several major strengths: a solid academic programme, a child centred approach and an unbeatable ambience.Ours is a private institution entirely dependent for our funding on school fees. Christian principles form our foundation and we are registered as a minority school. However admissions are open to children of all communitiesFrom 1866 to 1977 the School was run by the Sisters of the Community of St. Mary the Virgin, an Anglican order based in Wantage, England. In their hands the history of the School was one of continuous progress and growth.In 1977 it was decided at Wantage to hand over the School to seculars, as times had changed, and too much administrative work was involved in running a school, which the Community felt was incompatible with their religious life.In June 1976, Mrs. Elizabeth Matthew who had been a senior English teacher with the School since 1973, was appointed Vice Principal.The following year the Sisters withdrew from the School and Mrs. Elizabeth Matthew took over as Principal. During her tenure the School took a giant leap forward. The enrollment went up from 840 students to 2700. The curriculum was enriched, various amenities were added and the School was given a new look.The ICSE results every year were outstanding, with no failures, and 90% of the students securing over 75%.In June 1992, Mrs. Matthew started a Boy’s School, with one division of each class, from Upper Kindergarten to Std X. The Boys’ School is run on the same lines as the Girl’s School, except that their timings are different. The Girls’ School work from 8.40 a.m to 3.30 p.m and the Boys’ School from 7.40 a.m to 1.30 p.m. On Saturdays the boys have School till 11a.m. This is done so that the boys too can utilize the playgrounds, the swimming pool and all the other facilities we have.In March 2006, the Management appointed Mrs. Matthew as Executive Director of the School, in recognition of her years of dedicated service to St. Mary’s.  Miss Jessica Simoes who was Incharge of the Boys’ School took her place as Principal. But, it was sad day indeed for St Mary’s School, when our Executive Director Mrs Matthew lost her battle with cancer and passed away on the 13th of April 2009, after which the post of Executive Director has been abolished.In the academic year 2010-2011, Mrs. Sujata Mallic Kumar has been appointed as principal of the school.DetailsYear Established:1900",[],[]

SHEMROCK is promoted by the Arora family – which consists of two generations of the country’s leading educationists with over 100 years of combined experience in the field of education. It all started when Dr. D.R Arora and Dr. (Mrs.) Bimla Arora – a husband-wife team of academicians envisioned a school that presented the children with an education system that was based on their 30 years of academic experience in India and Abroad.

The grades were given different continents to work on and each large and spacious classroom was transformed into a distant land. What impressed me most was the relentless effort put in by the students under the guidance of their teachers.  Also, the school very tactfully decided to restrict the model-making to the classrooms and during school hours. Had the same task been given a homework, the parents contribution would have come out glaringly and we would still be unaware of the innate talents of our children. Every detail was looked into.', 'As a parent I am very satisfied with LPS. My child is in 3rd std and very eager to go to school everyday. He is very happy with his class teacher and the way she teaches maths. Initially he felt it was very difficult to get the concepts in maths and I was worried how to go ahead with this vast subject.

Children have a relationship with other children and with material items in the world that children must be allowed to explore and Children must have endless ways and opportunities to express themselves.DetailsSchool days:                        Monday - FridaySchool timings:9:00 am – 11:30 am / 12:00 pm – 2:30 pmExtra-curricular Activities:* Language Development - Rhymes* Listening Skills* Math – Block - Science* Self Help - Socialization Arts* Art - Music - Dance - Free PlayAdditional Details:* International Preschool* Play & Learn* International Standard* Sister School Relationship* Collaboration with International Schools* Play Group* Pre School* Kindergarten* Club 101 - Creative After School Program* Multi-Cultural Program","['https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/school/photo/580-large.bmp', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/school/photo/578-large.bmp', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/school/photo/579-large.bmp']",['am shalini.....i have finished B.E in 2010....and also am doing as a software testing engineer....am looking for home tutor job in anna nagar shanthi colony....']

Having my child studied in US it was not difficult for me to get an invite from this school (You get priority in admission if your kid studied in US). I visited the school with my kid. The location is deep inside Velachery with 'n' number of roads and turns. Buildings are moderate and the school seems to have only basic facilities. After waiting for half hour finally one lady came and introduced as admissions co-ordinators. After talking to her briefly, I sensed that the school is not worth referring to anyone. The management simply banking on ICSE curriculum to make big bucks. The management doesn't charge you capitation fee but you have to pay Rs. 40-50 K as onetime 'registration fee' to get your child admitted (Trust me I spent not more than $125 in US for my child for all of 5 years for their education). The English language of the staff sucks big time. After talking to them for sometime, I left the school probably never to return again. It seems many schools create an artificial hype about themselves in public forums added by desi parents, who get carried away by fancy names. I haven't seen the coaching aspect but I am not too positive about it either, after seeing the standard of few staff. The school management claims they do things very differently from other CBSE schools."", 'My daughter is 2 and a half years old and is put in Navadisha.', '', 'I am happy with the school as she enjoys the environment and never fusses or cries when she starts to school.

Today, with more than 3,00,000 children already having received the foundation for success from its 330+ branches, SHEMROCK, the Award Winning School Chain, is a leader in preschool education and is a brand to reckon with. SHEMROCK is promoted by the Arora family – which consists of two generations of the country’s leading educationists with over 100 years of combined experience in the field of education. It all started when Dr. D.R Arora and Dr. (Mrs.) Bimla Arora – a husband-wife team of academicians envisioned a school that presented the children with an education system that was based on their 30 years of academic experience in India and Abroad. They started a model school with the simple aim of creating a child-friendly & harmonious environment, focussing on the satisfaction of a child’s inquisitive mind and thorough concept clarity.DetailsSchool days:                        Monday-FridaySchool timings:8:30 AM to 2:00 PMPrincipal:Sangeeta AsnanYear Established:1989Extra-curricular Activities:At SHEMROCK, the curriculum is designed & developed to fit the requirements, interests, abilities & learning styles of the child rather than the vice-versa. As a result, our SHEMROCKites are the center of our educational process & system. The entire school programme is designed to enhance the social, emotional, spiritual, physical, motor and cognitive development of each child.Infrastructure:Each SHEMROCK school is designed to ensure an inviting, attractive and child-friendly environment for our SHEMROCKites. Moreover, our Special Learning Areas supplement the learning in the classroom as children learn with hands-on experience, in a practical manner in these special areas.Additional Details:For education at school to be effective, the environment needs to be conducive to learning, allowing the child the required space and time to interact within the learning and teaching process. Our schools are thus especially designed to create and maintain a stimulating learning environment where children can actively participate, grow & learn in a natural way.Admission Details:Playschool Admission process in SHEMROCK begins with counseling and completes on the receipt of admission fees and making the entry into the Record Register.A Birth Certificate as a proof of age from a civic body is required at the time of registration.Two passport sized photographs are to be submitted at the time of registration.",[],[]

Set up in 1988, we have journeyed through all these years and gained the trust and appreciation of thousands of students and their parents alike.Our philosophy of education has always been meeting the needs of the individual child. Children acquire skills and knowledge easily if we can make the surrounding stimulating and purposeful. In the 21st century, the Digital Revolution affects us all. Quite simply, it is changing everything: a brilliant barrage of information, entertainment, companionship and education is speedily available. In such a surrounding when work and effort is valued, the child's self -esteem is heightened, and from this results self-motivation. We try to understand and work with each child, and we firmly believe that it is our responsibility to enable the child in our care to develop as a whole.We all are concerned with children as they have lives beyond the classroom, and we cannot meet their needs if we show no concern for their activities outside school. We are the first institute in Eastern India to have started the concept of individual monitoring and counselling for the weaker students through 'Mentorship' which involves direct contact with the parents of such children by specially appointed mentor-teachers who analyze and devise ways to upgrade the back benchers.If innovation and novel ideas are a key to a bright future, then we can surely remain assured of our place under the pedagogic sun. We put forward a distinctive blend of offerings in the areas of knowledge and enterprise in the form of encouraging students for debates elocution and quiz contests as well as organizing and taking part in various cultural events. We also have an optional extra-curricular activity programme every Saturday where multifarious disciplines like music, dance, cricket, basketball, football, kickboxing, etc. are taught under the careful guidance of renowned coaches and teachers.Today, as we march towards the coveted silver jubilee of our existence, we pledge to work for every child- and in the process, open new vistas in the area of education.DetailsPrincipal:Mr. Herbert GeorgeManagement: M.

Our aim is to provide a friendly and caring international community, which values a holistic approach to education.The programme at ISA allows every child to be known as an individual, and to be encouraged and challenged accordingly. At the center of the School’s philosophy is the desire – necessity, even – to understand the needs of each child. While we have high academic and behavioral expectations, we believe every child can succeed, and class sizes and talented teachers at ISA encourage the students to grow and develop to their full potential.DetailsPrincipal:Neil Mc BurneyExtra-curricular Activities:- PHYSICAL EDUCATIONWithin Standards 3 – 8, Physical Education is a core subject, with 2 lessons timetabled each week.Within Standards 9 and 10, students may opt to study Physical Education as an IGCSE subject. This is a two year course focusing on both the practical and theoretical components of physical education.Currently the IBDP are piloting a new physical education course called Sports Science.

Entrance examinations are held prior to admission. Placements are confirmed only after an assessment of the student's latest school reports and the result of an entrance examination if required. Please note that all students are required to attend an interview with the Principal before confirmation of a place in the school.",[],"[""ISA has seen it's glorius years before. It's infrastructure is amazing. But since a year now, the school has been facing serious problems as far as teachers are concerned. A whole bunch of cream teaching staff has been sacked because of cost cutting. Primary & mid school kids are suffering because of this. Food quality has fallen down. The school is running since a few months without any principal. My advice to you is...all that glitters is not gold. Don't be fooled by it's ambience. The school just bears the Aamby brand name. For a whole lot of money that you shell out annually, it's not worth keeping your child in ISA. How do I know? My daughter studies in mid school there and we're really concerend about her future in this school along with a whole lot of other parents."", '', 'A well wisher.']"

She developed a method based on the premise that a child from birth to age six has an “absorbent mind” with a great capacity to learn. Dr. Montessori believed each person should educate himself. Her method encourages children to learn while preparing them for life.One way this is achieved is through hands-on lessons. “The hand is the instrument of the brain.” Said Dr. Montessori. The more senses involved in learning, the easier it is to learn. The Montessori method allows children to experience the excitement of learning without being forced while encouraging them to develop their own natural tools for learning.Details",[],[]

Your kid was studying in this school in the year 2009-10. Your child was not able to speak properly. Three months after your kid joined this bigger school your wife came over and praised us for all that your child learned in our school. Then she requested for a copy of the video of  the Annual day celebrations and paid for the same. In spite of reminding your wife more than 3 times she never collected the same from us. Then she requested the DVD to be sent through a teacher who was residing close to your house, for which we refused and asked her to come in person to collect the DVD. Then after a month later she called us and wanted a refund of the Rs. 300.00 that was paid towards the DVD. We refused as we had done no fault from our side. Now you retaliate by posting this review. Such uncouth behavior from you was not expected. Still wish you and your wonderful child all the very best in his future studies. Just hope he does not turn out to be like his parents.', 'Horrible place for a preschooler.

The fantastic infrastructure is very attractive.so is the food served in  the cafeteria. but that is about it. Teaching is substandard most times reflecting poor teaching skills and lack of organization. In spite of promises to use global methods, the middle school program uses primarily traditional methods. many teachers are ill equipped to deal with international students. Traditional disciplinary methods of threats and punishments are used often. But what really gets to you is the lack of concern and response from the management . Concerns taken up by parents are ignored or treated with hostility. Sometimes the issues are just denied. makes you question the integrity of the school.', 'Excellent school in terms of bringing out the leadership qualities in the children. The teachers are well educated and friendly and the whole atmosphere in the school is that of friendliness and freedom. My children love the school and do not want to miss it any day.

I focus mostly on the IB department and the management of the school.', '', 'First and foremost, every student joining Indus should know that, the students are viewed not as children or students at all, but just as sources of money.', 'All right, one could then say that even if this is so, if we\xe2\x80\x99re getting our money\xe2\x80\x99s worth in the education and facilities, it matters little. Well, the money does not seem to provide for the supposed ""world Class"" facilities the school boasts of.

In fact, liberty is suppressed at this school.', '', 'Moving on, one questions the school policy on bullying, alcoholism, smoking and drug consumption. The school conducts regular drug tests for students. it is a urine test for a which a report is generated. It has been observed that the school authorities used the drug test as a means to expel and target students they do not like. The school ignores the Legal International Standards for substance content in the body and without allowing the reports to be seen at all, expels students.', '', 'Furthermore, Individuals who are actually guilty of substance abuse, bullying or alcoholism face an even weirder sentence. Rather than protect the other students from the influence of such individuals, they don\xe2\x80\x99t expel these students but bring give them ""temporary suspensions"" and one may even see them back in school after a few weeks, as has been observed', '', 'The Management of the school needs to be questioned as well. Mind you, not the teachers but the staff such as the Vice principal and Principal. The vice principal for 2011-12, was Mr.Omkar Joshi. He is a rude, shameless and a highly unintelligent individual who appears absolutely uneducated and now he\xe2\x80\x99s been made principal of Indus Hyderabad. I wonder what the basis for promotion is?', '', 'The Principal, i must say has the biggest ego I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever encountered. All she wants ever one in the school to do is respect her and say ""All is well"". She asks for people to respect her, not earn respect through her actions. Like the vice principal she is extremely rude and one really has to think about what qualifies her to be a principal. She cannot take any feedback or criticism and plays favourites.', '', 'Elaborating upon Indus viewing kids as nothing but money bags, the school allows anyone and everyone into the school, just as long as they can pay. Indus is not an institution of education but a business. My friend suffered an asthmatic attack while on campus. He is a boarder. The school responded and he was hospitalised. After receiving treatment, he returned to school to join the boarding. But the school said no. They told him to leave the boarding and take up his own place in Bangalore or leave the school. Despite the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s approval, the school shut their doors to a boy who just came out of hospital whose family lived in Hyderabad. He had nowhere to live. This is what Indus said: "" We cannot be responsible for this student\xe2\x80\x99s health any longer."" If they cannot handle a common asthma case, is the school safe for anyone?

Outstanding teachers is one of the reasons for the excellent standards of education in this school. One of the reasons why teachers meet international standards is the in-house training which is given to them at Indus Training and Research Institute.

Principal & the management are very innovative in their ideas. A promising school esp for the parents & children who believe in keeping a good balance between academics & extra activities.', ""LSB overpromises and underdelivers.  The teachers are by and large,  the kind that shout at kids, throw books and stationery around in rage.  There is insufficient monitoring of students even in classrooms, let alone in corridors, and other spaces.  There are a high number of unsupervised free classes.There is a high level of bullying, name-calling and aggression among children and practically no adult intervention.  Feedback about kids' performance is mealy-mouthed, they say nothing negative or constructive. There is little gender-sensitivity in adult interactions with kids and insufficient role-modeling.   Kids are labelled and education is not integrative.  The kids from 'resource center' are called 'retards'.  There is little attempt at character-building or even consistency in decision-making.  Annual Day was a week before final exams, so that revision classes were cut short.  There was also a week-long theatre workshop before Annual Day.  This Day was shoddily conducted, with long delays, poor seating arrangements not to mention insufficient, overpriced food and drink.  Have your kids go here only if you cannot get them in anywhere else."", ""Devi you sound very derogatory and unbecoming and if you are a parent of Legacy then its really a very bad reflection on your character. I have been a parent since its inception in 2005 and haven't been happier with the conduct and gentle approach of the teachers and Principal. I do not believe that things are thrown by teachers and such labeling happens or my child would have have told me. My child and all her friends have bloomed and become confident, sensitive and caring people. The academics is a wonderful blend and the school takes care of integrating the activities and sports to give an all round development. I am so proud that my child is a part of Legacy and having seen it grow from 30 children to 370+ speaks for it self!  The Theatre Workshop was really beneficial and I know that  revision was not compromised. It was the Sports Day and the cultural aspect was indeed innovative. It did start late, I agree, but seeing that the children were happy and enthused was delightful. All you folks out there, Legacy is a great place to be in. Make it your first choice..."", 'The school is new and I have two sons going to the same school. The children came from a academically focused, very strict and disciplinarian school before and it was some what of a culture shock for them to experience academic & cultural freedom. The previous school put them down but the present school really gives them a lot of opportunities to blossom. The principal is very hands on and handles kids the right way. They have a good set of teachers but the focus is primarily on the senior classes now, so there may be few classes skipped at the lower level to accommodate the senior classes. The timing of the theatre workshop was poor but was well conducted and my children enjoyed the workshop. The workshop was optional for children but conducted by professionals. Next year they should plan to do the same but probably do it during the Jan period.  The annual sports day was also an enjoyable affair for the children. What I like about the school is that they try to even make parents participate in various activities and makes school a fun place for children to be.  The school definitely tries to give children a well rounded development. Focus in any specific area will have to be the responsibility of the parents.', 'Wishing the school all the best for the future.', 'Its definitely the kind of school we would have loved to have studied in. Ever since my son joined it 3 years ago as Vidyaniketan Academy we have been stress free and so has our son. The Principal is a gem. She knows just how to interact with the kids and is fair and understanding and has a really wonderful way with students. Legacy is not a great name, but we reconciled that the heart and soul is the same except for the Director trying to make it like all other schools and it has upset us, the thought that the Principal is the same gives us hope that it will be a place that children would love to go to even on holidays as was earlier. The sportsday was a bit late in the year. The children loved it and so we are happy. We parents need to support and help the school realise their vision and we agree what Samson has said about us parents.', ""Its sad to see that Legacy is not organised and as parents we feel let down that no info is given to us on time. Everything is last minute. Never seen this happen at Vidyaniketan Academy. The Principal gave prior notice for everything and was not a 'command' type of circular.Dont know its worrying to see a young no experience Director 'trying' to run a school. One thing to be parent and know first hand and another to know in theory. Just a bit of relief that the Principal is still the same. God Bless her."", 'Everything is last minute and we as parents are not even informed about vendors and expect we carry money around! Its all happening since the last year or so. VNA was more professional. Notices for fees raise, or books verything was sent at least 15-20 days before. Inexperienced Management. Too young to handle such a large institution. We wonder why the Principal is not being given her due. The Director interferes in everyhting I am told. Have to think over continuing. Good Luck and take over the reins Principal or your efforts will go waste', 'It is sad to hear from parents that the school is unorganized....i guess it is only the teething problem, since Legacy has moved into a new campus and there has been a flurry of new activities introduced for children. I hope by next year, the management is more experienced and things become orderly.', 'It would be great if there is a open house conducted for the parents, where troubling issues and complaints are discussed and sorted and so that the parents & school management can work together in making the school better.', 'Legacy as compared to VNA is more enjoyable & competitive for children. Thanks to the youthful, dedicated & friendly teachers, studying is an enjoyable activity too for the children. It is a very lively atmosphere inside the school.', 'VNA was also very lively and enjoyable and our kids loved it there than here. Understand new premises etc but there has to be planning and organising. The communication of important matters as given now is something that should have been done 3 months ago. I remember how Roopa used to give us ample time to plan our budget and also make provisions for increase in fees etc. Let this Director understand he is running a school and not a Company. Maybe its a wrong choice of profession on his part. I have reservations about teachers too. Dont know about an open forum as it may get chaotic. A better way is to write to the school. The Principal is really very prompt in replying and I feel so very reassured whenever I even exchange a few words. She has been the backbone and without her none of us will keep our children there and I speak for 80% of the parents.', 'sad to put 2 stars for VNA I could hv 10! Money making institution it sure is NOW. New school , infratructure expenses staff increase all we understand but its ridiculous money is being grabbed from us. No prior info. Whats the deal here? There are other options in Bangalore folks! Just that I feel bad for The Principal who started Vidyanikatan Academy and we loved it and sent so many. This new Director too young and egoistic and doent know where he is going and sinking the ship. Good luck to those who have joined and are there. Roopa Maam take care', 'Its very disappointing. Promises only from the Management. The Principal is down to earth and is clear about the vision. No one else. Its a lot of marketing gimmik from the Director. Accent and all but no content. Just rambles on and on. Wish the Principal was more the face of the school and the voice. Read a circular she had written on last day. It touched us and she is so sincere. Will wait another year and then we all will need to look elsewhere. Maam Principal please can we hear and see you more!', 'I am a student of this skool and i have only one question.. wat has happened to the old legacy?? i use to enjoy just going to this place.. but now.. i just dunno... one thing that has really put me off is the sudden fee hike.. not by 10% or 20% ,but by 100%!! this is not acceptable. we were told that there would be a gradual increase.. and this is definitely not         "" gradual"".. isnt there anyone to stop this??', 'my daughter is studying in 3d grade, i feel the school is providing complete education . that means the emphasis is for sports, arts,not forgetting academics too is wellbalanced', 'this is a very well organised school. the management is very approachable. Mr saad is a brilliant personality handling the school, the children look up at him as a role model. i am very happy with the schools approach towards academics . unlike other schools in Bangalore the study pressure is handled so well the child never feels burdened.', ""The best compliment to the school is from my son - he says ' Dad I cannot miss school a single day ! '"", 'Kudos Legacy for being the 8th best amongst 26 International Schools!! What a way to go and we are proud and happy that our children study at Legacy. Improvements are always a part of development and you will surely achieve the top spot.', ""We are with you and our particular congratulations to the Principal  Roopa who made this happen with her vision of 'Doing things differently and not doing different things' which was what she had said to us and said she quoted this from Shiv Khera's  book 'YOU CAN WIN'. She is so in tune with the children and their needs and understands with her soul. Fantastic blend and an overall development and rightly voted 1st for this.

By the end of the first year, he had indeed come a long way. into the second year of Montessori and he knew a lot, picked up speed in learning and the final year of Montessori (UKG) he just learns by the fly.', 'All this has been possible due to the dedication and commitment of the teachers and the caring attitude of the teaching and non-teaching staff at Bright Kids. I highly recommend this school to a parent of a 2 year old living in Bannerghatta Road area in Bangalore.']"
